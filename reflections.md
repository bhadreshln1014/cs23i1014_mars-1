The last page of the mars software task1 word file really described who i was before i started this project. i tried my best to use this opportunity to learn things that i had never heard of before, including shell scripting, bash, OOPs concepts, python libraries and so on and this helped me get out of my comfort zone and actually do some learning. 
although my learning might not be complete, i realised that i can learn given that i put in the effort for it. this task proved that in a matter of 7 days, i could potentially code and work in 3 different languages - even if not in a great depth.
overall, i had fun working on this task. 
as far as what i have learnt is concerned, ive attached a readme file in each of the folders, namely heavydose, mediumdose and lightdose - do check it out, thanks!
